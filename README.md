Monte Carlo Simulation 

Determining a risk-adjusted price for a 5-year Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) at which Avangrid can recontract a specific asset, balancing the guaranteed fixed revenue against the potential upside and inherent volatility of a full merchant market exposure. 

The solution involves a Monte Carlo simulation that decomposes market risk into Hub Price Risk and Basis Risk, generating 500 possible future price paths to calculate a fixed P75 (risk-adjusted) price that minimizes the downside risk. The final recommendation provides a strategic choice for Avangrid based on comparing this P75 price to the market's weighted forward price.
